I used this guide to set up rails on Yosemite (OSX):
http://railsapps.github.io/installrubyonrails-mac.html

Currently following this guide to make a blank application:
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#creating-the-blog-application

I initally had a weird issue when starting that said a node name couldn't be found.  Resolved it with this post:

Starting the server with this command:
	>rails s -b 0.0.0.0 -p 3000

And I am using "127.0.0.1" instead of "localhost" for starting the server and for looking at it in my browser
